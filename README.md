# Archive_Viewer_UI
The UI for a tool called Archive Viewer that was made for an employer of mine.


Using Bootstrap, Jquery, and JS Calendar I was tasked to make a friendly UI for the tool Archive Viewer. The UI for the most part is done but it was the back end I needed to work on. There is some code relating to the back end but the project was never finished. The tool was used to traverse the newspaper archives and it had to be user friendly for the reporters and such. The back end went through different technologies like nodejs and PHP. I have a working python CLI version in its own repository.
